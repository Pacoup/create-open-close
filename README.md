Create Open Close Utility
=========================

_The Create Open Close batch file utility for Windows._

This utility allows for the simple management of working and closed “ID” folders for task management with number-based request systems. It was initially created for internal use at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and has since been phased out for a system not dependent on Windows network drives.
